## Take Home Assessment

### Initialized using [Vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project)

## Setup

To get up and running after cloning the repo:

1. `yarn`
2. `yarn dev`


## Notes

Its a balance deciding where to put time and how to break things apart into smaller units of code while trying not to spend hours and hours. The main things I would change is improvements to react-dnd as sometimes it can be a bit buggy. For projects that are expected to get much larger, I tend to implement a file structure much different then what is here. I like to have independent directories for each component where the component file and test file will live. I also like to camel case files as there is sometimes issues with file systems reading filenames with no case sensitivity. I could implement react-router for more screens. I could use react-hook-form for handling form inputs and states easier. Loading and empty states are very bare, so those would need to look a lot better.
